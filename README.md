# Frontend README

## Overview

This frontend application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) backend. It leverages modern web technologies to deliver a responsive and engaging user experience.

## Technologies Used

1. **React**:
   - **Why Chosen**: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components, making the development process more efficient and maintainable. Its virtual DOM feature enhances performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM.

2. **TypeScript**:
   - **Why Chosen**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It helps catch errors during development, improves code quality, and enhances the overall developer experience with better tooling and autocompletion.

3. **Next.js**:
   - **Why Chosen**: Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. It improves performance and SEO, making it an excellent choice for building modern web applications.

4. **CSS Modules**:
   - **Why Chosen**: CSS Modules allow for modular and scoped CSS, preventing style conflicts and making it easier to manage styles in large applications.

5. **Axios**:
   - **Why Chosen**: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API. It simplifies the process of handling requests and responses, including error handling.

## Future Enhancements

The following features can be added to further enhance the frontend application:

1. **Content Rendering**:
   - Implement rendering capabilities for various content types, including:
     - **Images**: Display images dynamically based on user input or data fetched from the backend.
     - **Math Equations**: Use libraries like MathJax or KaTeX to render mathematical equations beautifully.
     - **Code Snippets**: Highlight code snippets using libraries like Prism.js or Highlight.js for better readability and presentation.
     - **Animations**: Integrate animation libraries (e.g., Framer Motion or GSAP) to visually explain algorithms and processes, making the application more engaging and educational.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication to allow users to save their progress, preferences, and history.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Enhance the user interface to be fully responsive across all devices, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance**:
   - Implement unit and integration tests using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.

## Challenges Faced

- **Connecting Frontend and Backend**:
  - Establishing communication between the frontend and backend required the creation of a RESTful API in the backend.
  - The frontend needed to make HTTP requests to these API endpoints to retrieve and send data.
  
- **CORS Issues**:
  - Encountered Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues when the frontend and backend were hosted on different ports. This required configuring Flask-CORS in the backend to allow requests from the frontend.
